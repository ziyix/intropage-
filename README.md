## Hi! Happy 2022 👋

My name is Ziyi Xu, a senior at the University of Southern California studying Data Science & Economics. Currently,I'm interested in healthcare💊, interactive media🎬 and contemporary Chinese internet culture🈚️. 

I've had experience building electronic health records system for small clinics, voice asistant email triage tool for disabled users, as well as a COVID-19 safety grocery shopping app. People who inspires me are citizen scientists and writers. I'm always intrigued by effective storytelling through 
interactive media, and I'm always down to make something.
